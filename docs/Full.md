# JamsPlayer

Full implementation of the player

## Functionality over MVP

* Multiple song lists
* Sharing of lists instead user profiles

* Multiple accounts?
* * What is needed to sign in, do we want to save previous accounts locally? What do we want to show for locally created accounts that exist already? -username/profile image? So when the user clicks sign in, they can choose from a previously logged in account or a register button. When signed in, it shows the profile image, which when clicked shows information such as balance, username etc. When a user logs out the profile image goes away and just shows the sign in button.
