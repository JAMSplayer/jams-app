# Workflow

Project management is done in [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/JAMSplayer/projects/1).

Design documents are in `docs` directory of repo, and are kept up-to-date, so they are an actual reflection of project direction and status, based on latest arrangements.

Discussions happen on [Matrix room](https://app.element.io/#/room/!jcpBMeTNGJCpcegRsb:matrix.org).

If there's a relevant issue/PR in GitHub about something, we should discuss there, otherwise (like new features etc.) â€“ a Matrix chat. Discussions on Matrix via threads, and then when decided it's an actionable issue - move to github issues.

Code is developed in Git feature branches and merged to main when reviewed.

We commit lockfiles (Cargo.lock, yarn.lock etc.)

## Test release

Test releases are automatically generated by GitHub CI/CD system, when new commits are pushed to *release-process* branch. Once all PRs planned for release are merged into *main*, The process of releasing looks like this:

1. Switch to *release-process* branch

1. Merge *main* branch

1. Update changelog in `.github/workflows/main.yml` file, under `releaseBody` key of *tauri-apps/tauri-action@v0* step. If possible, include PR numbers, so that testers could easily check what functionalities have to be tested.

1. Update app version in files `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` and `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`.

1. Make a commit. It's name should be an app version, for example `v0.1.3`.

1. Push to GitHub repo.
