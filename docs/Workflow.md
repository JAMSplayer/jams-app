Project management is done in [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/JAMSplayer/projects/1).

Design documents are in `docs` directory of repo, and are kept up-to-date, so they are an actual reflection of project direction and status, based on latest arrangements.

Discussions happen on [Matrix room](https://app.element.io/#/room/!jcpBMeTNGJCpcegRsb:matrix.org).

Code is developed in Git feature branches and merged to main when reviewed.
