Project management is done in [GitHub project](https://github.com/orgs/JAMSplayer/projects/1).

Design documents are in `docs` directory of repo, and are kept up-to-date, so they are an actual reflection of project direction and status, based on latest arrangements.

Discussions happen on [Matrix room](https://app.element.io/#/room/!jcpBMeTNGJCpcegRsb:matrix.org).

If there's a relevant issue/PR in GitHub about something, we should discuss there, otherwise (like new features etc.) â€“ a Matrix chat. Discussions on Matrix via threads, and then when decided it's an actionable issue - move to github issues.

Code is developed in Git feature branches and merged to main when reviewed.

We commit lockfiles (Cargo.lock, yarn.lock etc.)
